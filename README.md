# A Discord Bot with Chip-8 Emulator
This project is totally for fun purposes. Most likely this goes against discord ToS. Code is pretty simple and it is obviously designed for use of only myself.<br>
Probably filled with ~~bugs~~ features<br>
However, i achieved what i was trying to do and it is enough. No plan to develop this project further.<br>

## For Chip-8 Emulator
Chip-8 Emulator is completly done by me. For more info about it, check out actual repo for chip-8 emu. <br>
It is also free to use, but i would like it if you star the repo before using it.<br>

## For Image Generation API
Since i couldn't use emojis for this project i had to do an api for generating images. You can check out the repo for the code generating image<br>
<br>
Note: Discord doesn't allow url to be more than 2048 chars. So i had to pack screen bits to bytes which allowed me to decrease the length of the url. Usually if you are using this on another project you wouldn't do something like that <br>
